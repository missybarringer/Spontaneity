#  Project Title-*Spontaneity*

*Spontaneity* is a travel companion for spontaneous groups that whimsically travel and want data-driven support for their whimsical travel decision-making.  *Spontaneityâ€™s* purpose is to help you spontaneously make a decision of where to visit if you are an open-minded spontaneous adventurer by providing you with a one-stop shop dashboard that streamlines the process of acquiring data to make a travel decision.

## How it Works
*Spontaneity* allows a user to enter a travel destination and a date to search locations.  Upon submitting, the user will be provided date-specific information on their potential destination.  Information includes location-specific weather forecasts, events occurring during the time period that they will be at the destination, as well as a list of some of the best restaurants at your destination.
